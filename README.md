# Cogniscruit

**Generating Interview Questions for Candidates Using Large Language Models (LLMs)**

---

## Project Overview

Cogniscruit is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the process of generating personalized interview questions based on a candidate's resume, LinkedIn profile, and other relevant sources. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract insights and generate tailored questions, saving time and ensuring consistency in the interview process.

---

## Problem Statement

Interviewers often need to research a candidateâ€™s background and formulate relevant questions, which can be time-consuming and inconsistent. Our solution automates this process by extracting key information from resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and other sources, and generating personalized interview questions.

---

## What It Does

- Generates tailored interview questions based on candidate profiles (e.g., resumes, LinkedIn URLs).
- Uses job descriptions or role requirements to generate relevant questions.
- Assesses specific topics or skills to provide a comprehensive interview experience.

---

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** Recruiters or interviewers input candidate details, job descriptions, or topics.
2. **Data Processing:** The system extracts key information (e.g., skills, experience) from resumes or URLs.
3. **AI Question Generation:** Uses Gemini to generate relevant, tailored interview questions.
4. **Output:** A list of tailored interview questions is generated for the user.
